# Initialize the first two terms of the sequence 
a, b = 1, 2 
# Initialize the sum variable 
sum = 0 
# Loop while the value of b is less than or equal to four million 
while b <= 4000000: 
 # Check if the current term is even 
    if b % 2 == 0: 
 # If so, add it to the sum variable 
        sum += b 
 # Generate the next term in the sequence 
    a, b = b, a + b 
# Print the sum of the even-valued terms 
print(sum) 

#Output: 
#613732
